# 2019-nCoV

Visualizing and modeling the 2019-nCoV is the main objective here. The data are coming from [JHU nCov](#jhu-ncov). 

As I don't know anything about javascript, so I'm trying to use R to implement this idea. So the initial idea was to create an animated map with dots. Then I come into this [github](#2019-wuhan-ncov) and created similar plot within R.
