# 2019-nCoV

Visualizing and modeling the 2019-nCoV is the main objective here.
As I don't know anything about javascript, so I'm trying to use R to implement this idea. So the initial idea was to create an animated map with dots. Then I come into this [github](https://github.com/globalcitizen/2019-wuhan-coronavirus-data/) and created similar plot within R.
